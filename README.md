# IsOK

A library for making it easier to use ok/error responses in Ruby case statements.  Written by someone who missed case statements with pattern matching in Elixir :)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'is_ok'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ok

## Usage

For usage instructions, see [these tests](test/is_ok_test.rb)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
